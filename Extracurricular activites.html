   <p>When I’m not busy dodging rogue cactus spines, I like to branch out into a variety of hobbies that keep life just as exciting (and occasionally as hazardous). From cactus-themed charity events to attempting to convert my neighbors into succulent enthusiasts, my extracurricular pursuits are as diverse and resilient as my beloved plants. Below are a few of my “thorny” achievements beyond the farm!</p>
   <h2>In my spare time I enjoy visiting the following:</h2>
