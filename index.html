    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Prickly by nature but sharp in business, I’m a dedicated British cactus farmer with a passion for plants that thrive on neglect—much like my sense of humor. I’ve spent years cultivating a thriving desert paradise in the heart of the English countryside, where the rain politely minds its own business (most of the time). Whether it’s taming rogue succulents, hosting “hug-a-cactus” workshops (waivers required), or negotiating with particularly stubborn aloe vera, I’ve got the green thumb and thorn-proof gloves to handle it all. Looking to branch out and bring my unique expertise to new soil—just don’t ask me to water the office plants.</p>
